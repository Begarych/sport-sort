# sport-sort
Sorting players by different criteria using a GUI
In this program, I was able to analyze
libraries for the implementation of the graphical interface, choose the most
suitable, examine the components of the Windows form library, examine
Windows form algorithms, learn MVC principles; choose funds
development, implement the project using the GUI.
I was able to improve and simplify the already existing program code with
using the studied libraries. I managed to create a simple
GUI for my console program using
windows forms.
Using the standard STL template library, you can significantly
speed up and simplify work with the C++ language.
